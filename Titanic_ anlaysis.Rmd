# Goal
The goal of this analysis is to analyze what type of passenger are more
likely to survive base on list of features and build a predictive model
to make prediction.


```{r loading_data}
library(tidyverse)

# read data
original.titanic.train <- read.csv("train.csv")
original.titanic.test <- read.csv("test.csv")

# Make a temporary copy
titanic.train <- original.titanic.train

# Check each variable type and what data looks like
str(titanic.train)


```

```{r cleaning data}

# Convert some variables to proper type

titanic.train$Survived <- factor(titanic.train$Survived, levels = c(1,0),
                                                         labels = c(1,0))
titanic.train$Pclass <- as.factor(titanic.train$Pclass)

# check missing values
colSums(is.na(titanic.train))
colSums(titanic.train== "")

#fill mode value to Embarked

table(titanic.train$Embarked)
subset(titanic.train, Embarked == "")
titanic.train[c(62,830),]$Embarked <- "S"

# Split first letter of "Cabin" 
with_cabin <- subset(titanic.train, Cabin != "")
cabin_vector <- with_cabin$Cabin
str_split(cabin_vector,pattern="",n=2) -> cabin_list
cabin_letterlist <- c()
j <- 1

for (i in cabin_list){
  cabin_letterlist[j] <- i[1]
  j <- j+1
}

with_cabin$Cabin_letter <- cabin_letterlist

# Merge data back to titanic set

merge(titanic.train,with_cabin, all = TRUE) -> titanic.train
```


```{r predict missing age using other features}

# Use row with non-null Age value to predict the remaining missing Age values

with_age <- subset(titanic.train, !(is.na(Age)) )
no_age <- subset(titanic.train, (is.na(Age)))


# select potential features for predictor

age_predictor <- lm(Age~ Survived + Pclass + Sex + SibSp + Parch + Fare + Embarked, data = with_age)

summary(age_predictor)

# By Backward model selection

# delete Sex

age_predictor <- lm(Age~ Survived + Pclass + SibSp + Parch + Fare + Embarked, data = with_age)

summary(age_predictor)

# delete Parch

age_predictor <- lm(Age~ Survived + Pclass + SibSp  + Fare + Embarked, data = with_age)

summary(age_predictor)

# delete Embarked

age_predictor <- lm(Age~ Survived + Pclass + SibSp  + Fare, data = with_age)

summary(age_predictor)

# All variables are statistically significant, use above model to predict missing age
predicted_age <- predict(age_predictor, newdata = no_age)
no_age$Age <- predicted_age

# make a copy with titanic.train where all missing age are filled
titanic.train <- rbind(no_age,with_age)
titanic.train <- arrange(titanic.train, PassengerId)
```

```{r analyze Survived vs features}
